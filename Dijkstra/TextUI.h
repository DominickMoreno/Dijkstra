/* Text Interface Header file

		This is what lets the user interact with the
	Dijkstra program. This class is menu driven. 
	Future versions may have a GUI instead.

		It's fairly simple, but that's on purpose.
	The goal is going to be to have this class do
	as little work as possible, as I'd like to 
	eventually make this program with a proper
	GUI.
